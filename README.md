# 100 days of statistics


This is a personal exercise to learn statistics one day at a time. Statistics is a very exhaustive field and it will take years to become an expert. 
As statistics is an integral part of Machine Learning and data science, it is imperative to have a good grasp of different statistical concepts.
For this, I am aiming to learn statistics bit by bit, one concept at a time. My first goal is to complete this 100 daya challenge where I learn something everyday.
This includes a lot of unlearning as most of the concepts to be learned n initial days might be already covered in our high school math/ statistics course.
I wish to learn statistics intuitively with lots of practice and analysing real world problems. 

The following are the resources, I believe, will help in my journey:

1. An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R.
Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2014.  Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated.

2. Statistics in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition
by Sarah Boslaugh Released November 2012 Publisher(s): O'Reilly Media, Inc.

3. An Introduction to Statistics: An Active Learning Approach
by Kieth A. Carlson  (Author), Jennifer R. Winquist (Author) 

4. The Elements of Statistical Learning
T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman. Springer Series in Statistics Springer New York Inc., New York, NY, USA, (2001)



So, <b> Happy learning !!! </b>
