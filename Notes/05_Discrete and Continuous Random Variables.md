# Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

- A **Variable** is a quantity whose value changes
- A **Discrete variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by counting . eg: Number of students in a class, number of marbles in a jar
- A **Continuous Variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring eg: Height of students in a class
- A **random variable** is a variable whose value is determined by random chance
    - A random variable is denoted by a capital letter
    - Probability distribution of a random variable X tells what the possible values of X are and how probabilities are assigned to those values
    - Random variable can be discrete or continuous
- A **Discrete random variable**  X has countable number of possible values.
    - To graph the probability distribution of X, we construct probability histogram
- A C**ontinuous random variable** X takes all values in a given interval of values:
    - The Probability distribution of a continuous random variable is shown by a density curve
    - The Probability that X is between an interval of numbers  is the area under the density curve between the interval points
    - The probability that X is exactly equal to a number is Zero.

### Mean and Variances of Random Variables

- The mean of discrete random variable is its **weighted average.** Each value of X is weighted by its probability
- To find the mean of X, multiply each value of X by its probability and then add all the products :

    $Âµ_n = \sum_i^n x_ip_i$

- The mean of random variable X is called **expected** value of X
- If X is a discrete random variable with mean $\mu$ , then the variance of X is

$$\sigma^2 = \sum_i^n(x_i - \mu_x)^2p_i$$
